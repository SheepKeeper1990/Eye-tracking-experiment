# Eye-tracking-experiment
This project provides a program for drawing experimental data and results of eye tracking using the algorithm proposed in the paper “A local optical flow eye tracking method for depression detection”

%   The experimental part of the eye tracking method for depression based on local optical flow estimation in the paper outputs a projection of 
%   a three-dimensional image, that is, a two-dimensional image, for easy observation of the distribution in the x and y directions.
